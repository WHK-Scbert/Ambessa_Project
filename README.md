# Todo:
[ ] If nmap_result.txt is there, just `cat nmap_result.txt` (should be easy to do)
[ ] Ensure that the chat history is there (looks like it can get off track sometimes)
[ ] Ask for another command when the tool is not already installed
[ ] How to work with Metasploit (very useful)
[ ] Test for background Brute Force
[ ] Working with Rags to initially feed in more data right off the bat
